      <h1>KVaser LabView CAN VIs</h1>
      
      <p>The KVaser LabView CAN VIs implement the LabView interface to the
      KVaser CAN runtime library.  These VIs provide the same functionality
      as is present in the library.  The VIs are all named kvCanXXX, where "XXX"
      is the name of a CAN library function.
      
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>The VIs require the CANLIB SDK.  They use functions defined in the
      CANLIB DLL (CanLib32.dll), which must be present in the execution path for the VIs to
      run.  The execution path is the current working directory, a directory
      specified in the PATH environment variable, or the standard Windows System32
      directory.  The CANLIB SDK install
      program automatically installs the DLL into the path by copying it into
      the standard windows System32 directory.
      
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Install LabView
         <li>Install the KVaser CANLIB SDK.
         <li>Install the KVaser LabView CAN VIs in any directory.
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>The VIs are used like any LabView VI.  They may be installed in any
         directory.
      
         <li>Read the CANLIB SDK documentation, which lists the available functions
         and provides examples on their usage.
      
         <li>Open the kvCanTree.vi VI.  It contains additional details on the
         VIs and their usage.
         
         <li>Look at the kvCanTree.vi diagram for a list of all VIs.
         
         <li>Look at the kvCanExample1.vi.  This VI is a VERY simple example
         that writes a single message to the CAN bus, and reads a single message
         from the bus.
